# Paper List in the survey paper
The papers that we are surveying are listed in this file. The papers are grouped by the following categories:
- [Foundation models used in Robotics](#foundation-models-used-in-robotics). For these papers, the authors apply existing foundation models, such as LLM, VLM, vision FM and text-conditioned image generation models in modules of robotics, such as perception, decision making and planning, and action.

- [Robotic Foundation Models](#robotic-foundation-models). For these papers, the authors propose new foundation models used in one specific robotic applications, such as control using imilation learning and reinforcement learning. We also include genera-purpose foundation models, such as GATO, PALM-E in this category.
